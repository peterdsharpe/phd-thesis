\chapter{Traceable Physics Models}
\label{chap:physics}

This thesis also contributes computational implementations of several key physics models for aircraft design that are traceable within the example code transformations framework introduced in Section \ref{sec:aerosandbox}, AeroSandbox. The broad motivation for this contribution stems from the observation that ``ease-of-model-implementation'' has historically proven to be one of the most important factors for determining whether an MDO paradigm can achieve use in industry. More specifically, the goals of this contribution are to:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Stress-test the feasibility of code transformations in practice—how much added user effort and expertise is required to bring typical engineering analyses into a code-transformations-based MDO tool? To what extent can existing code be used as-is? Finally, the thesis aims to identify any specific computational elements that cause ``pain points'' when attempting to make an analysis traceable.
    \item Jump-start future applied research by providing a set of modular, plug-and-play analyses that can be used to quickly build a variety of aircraft design optimization problems. Since the long-term goal of this research direction is to establish whether the proposed MDO paradigm improves practicality, many practical aircraft design problems must be posed. Creating a set of modular general-purpose building blocks reduces the need to write similar analysis code repeatedly, saving time for designers.
\end{enumerate}

To achieve these goals, this thesis contributes the traceable implementations of the analyses given in Table \ref{tab:models_to_contribute}. This set of analyses was deliberately chosen to be mathematically diverse, spanning a wide range of common code patterns in scientific computing. The types of attributes that each analysis is intended to stress-test are given in the right-most column of Table \ref{tab:models_to_contribute}.

These traceable implementations offer value within the context of the thesis itself (in stress-testing the practicality of code transformations), but they also have value as a standalone contribution to the aircraft design community—even outside of design optimization. Because of the mixed-backend numerics library described in Section \ref{sec:code_syntax}, these analyses can be used independently from the design optimization context of AeroSandbox if desired. In such cases, however, they still can retain certain runtime benefits from the code transformations framework, if desired by the user. For example, a traceable workbook-style aerodynamics buildup would seamlessly enable GPU-accelerated evaluations and automatic vectorization, offering significant speedups; an example application might be real-time performance estimation for model predictive controllers or flight simulation.


\section{Vortex-Lattice Method Aerodynamics Analysis}
\label{sec:vlm}

\subsection{Method Overview}
\label{sec:vlm_theory}

The vortex-lattice method (VLM) is a low-fidelity aerodynamics analysis used to model the inviscid 3D flow field around a system of lifting surfaces (e.g., wings). It is one of the most common conceptual-level aerodynamics analyses used in aircraft design, as it is computationally inexpensive and interpretable. Common tools that implement the VLM include AVL \cite{avl} and XFLR5 \cite{xflr5}.

A VLM analysis is based on classical potential-flow theory. Because this flow field model is a linear partial differential equation, it can be quickly solved using a boundary-element method representation by superimposing Green's-function kernels. These kernels model disturbances in the flow field that are induced by the lifting surfaces. In a VLM analysis, these kernels are modeled as a collection of \emph{horseshoe vortices} that are distributed along the wing in a regular lattice pattern (distributed in both spanwise and chordwise directions). A single horseshoe vortex is illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:horseshoe_vortex}. Each horseshoe vortex is a connected polyline of uniform-strength vortex filaments, with three segments: a bound vortex on the wing, and two trailing legs extending downstream to infinity\footnote{These trailing legs extend to the far-field Trefftz plane. In theory, these trailing legs should follow the local flow direction (and hence be ``force-free'' by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem), but often they are simply extended directly backwards which simplifies induced velocity computation and removes the need for an iterative wake relaxation.}. (In practice, a fourth leg consisting of a far-downstream ``starting vortex'' can be imagined to close the horseshoe vortex, which forms a ring vortex and thus satisfies the Helmholtz vortex theorems.) The Kutta condition is naturally satisfied, as the only place where the wing can shed vorticity is at the trailing edge (due to placement of the trailing legs).

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=5in]{../figures/horseshoe_vortex.png}
    \caption{Illustration of a horseshoe vortex (black) and the induced fluid velocity field around it, which is the fundamental building block of a VLM analysis. In reality the induced velocity field has global influence, but it is truncated here for conceptual clarity.}
    \label{fig:horseshoe_vortex}
\end{figure}


Each horseshoe vortex has an initially-unknown strength, and the vorticity associated with each vortex creates an induced velocity that affects the global flowfield. To solve for these $N$ unknown vortex strengths, $N$ constraints are needed. A convenient choice is to impose a \emph{flow-tangency} (also called \emph{no-penetration}) boundary condition associated with each horseshoe vortex, where the flow velocity normal to each horseshoe vortex is zero. It is not immediately obvious at which location this flow-tangency condition (called the \emph{collocation point}) should be imposed, relative to each horseshoe vortex. As it turns out, the best choice is to discretize the wing into quadrilateral panels, then place the bound leg at the quarter-chord point of each panel, and place the collocation point at the three-quarter-chord point. This choice results in higher-order convergence with respect to discretization resolution than any other choice, with derivation for this given by Katz and Plotkin \cite{katz_lowspeed_2004}. (One way to intuitively understand this reasoning is that the VLM is essentially a 3D analogue of 2D thin airfoil theory.)

Because of the linearity of the governing equations, the unknown horseshoe vortex strengths can be solved as a linear system of equations. Due to the global influence of each vortex on the flowfield, this linear system of equations is dense and asymmetric, so it is typically solved using LU factorization. The solution to this linear system gives the vortex strengths, which can then be used to reconstruct the flowfield around the lifting surfaces. The vortex strengths are also conveniently equal to the local difference in pressure coefficient between the top and bottom surfaces of the wing, which can be used to visually interpret the flow field. Lift force computation is usually performed using the Kutta-Joukowski theorem on each bound leg. Drag force calculation (which only includes induced drag, as a VLM is inviscid) can be accurately performed using a Trefftz plane wake integral. Further details on this analysis formulation are available in work by Katz and Plotkin \cite{katz_lowspeed_2004} and Drela \cite{drela_flight_2013}.

\subsection{Implementation}

\subsubsection{Discretization}

Based on this theory, a vortex lattice method was implemented into AeroSandbox as a traceable analysis. One of tasks when implementing this analysis is discretizing the geometry (i.e., generate a mesh) in a code-transformations compatible way. Because discretization of a high-level geometry representation is such a common task in engineering analysis, an aircraft geometry stack was built within AeroSandbox to facilitate this. This stack allows one to represent an aircraft geometry at a conceptual level (i.e., within a hierarchical data structure that is not tied to any specific analysis), and then to generate a variety of degenerate geometry representations from this conceptual geometry. These degenerate geometry representations could be a series of 1D beams (for structural analysis), a mean camber line geometry representation (for a VLM aerodynamics analysis), a 3D panel geometry representation (for visualization or for CFD analysis), or any other representation that is needed for a specific analysis. Examples of such degenerate geometry representations that are possible are illustrated in Figure \ref{fig:degen_geometry}. This capability to separate the concept of geometry from its representation makes it much easier to implement multi-physics analysis that may be required in MDO problems.

Conceptually, the ideas behind this geometry stack are inspired by the degenerate geometry representation capabilities of OpenVSP \cite{mcdonald_open_2022}, with the difference that this is built on top of a traceable numerics core. Because of this, these meshes gain all the properties enabled by code transformations, such as differentiable meshing. Furthermore, if analyses are built on top of this geometry stack, the analysis can be end-to-end differentiable throughout both discretization and solution.

This unified, vertically-integrated workflow contrasts with many current design optimization workflows, which instead usually treat meshing and solving as separate black-box tools. In cases where end-to-end gradients are required (i.e., aerodynamic shape optimization with respect to a set of design variables), the usual strategy is to compute gradients for each process and then later to stitch them together. For example, a meshing tool might use forward-mode automatic differentiation\footnote{or, if the mesh has a deterministic connectivity (i.e., hyperbolic marching from a surface), one could use a method with similar properties, like complex-step differentiation or finite-differencing}, while a solver might use a discrete adjoint of the governing PDE to obtain mesh gradients. Stitching these gradients together is a perfectly viable solution from a computational perspective, but as a practical matter it often requires a fair amount of boilerplate code from the user. In contrast, unifying the meshing and solution processes within a code transformations framework eliminates the need for the user to manually interact with component partials, lessening the expertise required to build a differentiable analysis.

\end{figure}

\subsubsection{Solution Methodology Considerations}

With meshing complete, the governing system of equations described in Section \ref{sec:vlm_theory} can be implemented. Within the context of a code transformations framework, an interesting question is whether this system should be solved explicitly or implicitly. To clarify the difference here:

\begin{itemize}
    \item In an \textbf{explicit} formulation, the matrix and right-hand-side vector of the linear system of equations are explicitly constructed within the analysis code, and the system is solved using a direct solver. In the context of a broader optimization problem encompassing such a model, this means that a) the system of governing equations is solved exactly at each iteration, and b) no optimization variables or constraints are added to the solve.

    \item In an \textbf{implicit} formulation, the horseshoe vortex strengths are posed as optimization variables, and the governing equations are implemented in residual form and constrained (in the top-level optimzation problem) to be driven to zero. This is analogous to a simultaneous-analysis-and-design MDO problem formulation (shown in Figure \ref{fig:sand}). Here, the matrix and right-hand-side vector of the linear system are never explicitly constructed within the analysis code (though of course, the optimization problem constraint Jacobian will essentially compute this same information). In the context of a broader optimization problem encompassing such a model, this means that a) the system of governing equations is solved approximately at each iteration, and b) optimization variables and constraints are added to the solve.

\end{itemize}

Both methods have advantages. The principal advantage of the explicit formulation is that incorporating this into a design optimization framework can yield more stable convergence, since ``correct'' (i.e., zero-residual) solutions are guaranteed at each iteration. This can be especially important in the context of a multidisciplinary optimization problem, where this VLM analysis might be combined with other analyses. Here, a fully coupled implicit system might become numerically unstable (e.g., numerically-stiff), leading to convergence difficulties.

On the other hand, the implicit formulation has the potential to be much faster, in the context of a broader optimization problem. This is because the optimizer is solving for primal feasibility (i.e., constraint violation) and dual feasibility (i.e., optimality conditions) simultaneously. An intuitive way to think about this is that the optimizer is not wasting CPU cycles by solving the analysis accurately during early iterations, when the solution is far from the optimum. Instead, the optimizer is solving the analysis just enough to ensure that the constraints are satisfied, and then moving on to the next iteration. This can lead to significant speedups (up to an order of magnitude, in the author's experience) in the context of a broader optimization problem, especially when the analysis is expensive to solve.

There are also some cases where this implicit solution can be favorable in augmented analyses. For example, if a panel method is coupled with an integral boundary layer model (e.g., in XFoil), solving the problem as a coupled system rather than a segregated disciplinary solve can resolve singularity issues that might otherwise appear \cite{drela_xfoil_1989, drela_viscousinviscid_1987, ranneberg_viiflow_2019, fidkowski_coupled_2022, zhang_threedimensional_2022}.

In the case of the present VLM implementation, both formulations are offered, with the explicit solution being the default. This is because the explicit solution is more stable and easier to debug, and because the VLM analysis is relatively inexpensive to solve. However, the implicit solution is also available, and can be used if the user desires faster convergence in the context of a broader optimization problem.

\subsection{Example Results}

Figure \ref{fig:vlm} shows the results of a VLM analysis performed using AeroSandbox, using a generic glider design and a prescribed aerodynamic operating point. At the moderately high paneling resolution shown here ($N=700$ panels), solution takes about 0.25 seconds on a laptop-grade CPU. The surface color shows the vortex strength (or equivalently, $\Delta C_p$ across the wing), while the streamlines show the flow field.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/vlm.png}
    \caption{AeroSandbox VLM analysis results for a simple glider geometry at a prescribed aerodynamic operating point. Surface color shows the vortex strength (or equivalently, $\Delta C_p$ across the wing). Streamlines show the flow field.}
    \label{fig:vlm}
\end{figure}

Quantitative validation results for this VLM analysis are shown later in Section \ref{sec:aero_validation}, where the VLM can be cross-compared not only against external tools but also against the other plug-and-play aerodynamic analyses developed in this chapter. Notably, while the VLM method is quite accurate for computing induced drag, it has no mechanism to compute profile drag without augmentation by another aerodynamic method, like the buildup described in Section \ref{sec:aerobuildup}; hence, the VLM method should not be used by itself for performance analysis. It is, however, more than adequate for flight dynamics analysis, as there are few other low-fidelity aerodynamics methods that handle local velocity effects (e.g., dynamic derivatives, aerodynamic damping) as accurately.

\subsection{Aerodynamic Shape Optimization}

To demonstrate how this VLM tool can be incorporated into a broader optimization problem, we can formulate a classic aerodynamic shape optimization problem and compare our result to a known solution.

Here, we aim to find the minimum-induced-drag wing planform, by optimizing a wing's chord distribution. We assume:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep]
    \item A fixed total lift
    \item A fixed wing area
    \item A fixed span
    \item An untwisted, uncambered, unswept, thin, planar wing
    \item Potential flow (inviscid, incompressible, irrotational, and steady)
\end{itemize}

For this fixed-span, fixed-lift case, theory shows that the minimum-induced-drag wing has an elliptical lift distribution. With the additional assumptions above, the corresponding minimum-induced-drag wing will also have an elliptical \emph{chord} distribution \cite{anderson_fundamentals_2009}.

This problem can be posed in AeroSandbox syntax using the plug-and-play VLM analysis model described in the previous section. We supply an initial guess of a simple rectangular (i.e. untapered) wing, and optimize the chord distribution. We do not know the correct angle of attack $\alpha$ to achieve our specified lift coefficient \emph{a priori}, so this becomes an additional optimization variable. The VLM is implemented, here using just one spanwise panel for each unknown chord variable—typically, a higher resolution ($\sim 4$ panels per optimization variable) would be used for numerical stability, but this is used to demonstrate numerical robustness of the implementation here.

Surprisingly, the entire optimization problem can be written in less than 40 lines of code, allowing it to be shown in its entirety in Listing \ref{lst:vlm_optimization}. This serves as a good illustration of the motivation behind developing these plug-and-play models for a code transformations framework—the modularity allows complex optimization problems to be posed with minimal code.

The optimization problem is solved to tolerance within 18 IPOPT iterations, corresponding to around 10 seconds of wall-clock time on a laptop CPU. This yields the wing geometry shown in Figure \ref{fig:vlm_opt}, which is indeed elliptical in chord distribution. To confirm, the chord distribution can be directly compared to an elliptical distribution as shown in Figure \ref{fig:vlm_opt_compare}. Very slight differences appear due to numerical discretization, but as panel resolution is increased, these results converge.

\section{Nonlinear Lifting Line Aerodynamics Analysis}
\label{sec:ll}

\subsection{Method Overview}

While the VLM described in Section \ref{sec:vlm} is a useful tool in conceptual analysis, its inviscid nature means that it cannot capture many important aerodynamic effects. This includes profile drag effects, but also more subtle effects like nonlinear sectional lift curve slopes and local stall. Another downside of the VLM is that capturing camber effects requires a substantial number of chordwise panels, which quickly increases the size of the linear system\footnote{The solve time of this linear system scales as $\order(N^3)$ with the number of panels, so keeping the number of panels low is quite valuable.} without meaningfully improving the induced drag prediction (as this is dominated by spanwise effects).

One way to address both of these limitations is to use a lifting-line method instead of a VLM. A modern lifting-line method is best conceptually understood as a vortex lattice method with several key similarities and differences:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item First, just as with the VLM, the lifting-line method uses a potential flow model with horseshoe vortices to model the flow changes induced by the vehicle.
    \item Another difference is that in a lifting-line method the governing equation no longer comes from a flow-tangency condition. Instead, the constraint relationship comes from equating the lift force generated by the vortex (via the Kutta-Joukowski theorem) to the lift force computed using a 2D sectional model (i.e., airfoil-level data) and the local angle of attack.
    \item A notable difference is that in a lifting line method only one chordwise panel is required, because camber effects are not captured by direct flow tangency over the curved surface.
\end{enumerate}

This constraint relationship, which is detailed further in by Phillips and Snyder \cite{phillips_modern_2000}, allows the lifting-line method to leverage the accuracy of 2D sectional data, which can include camber effects. In almost all existing lifting-line methods, the sectional data is approximated using an affine $C_L$-$\alpha$ relationship (possibly with a nonzero $C_L$ at $\alpha=0$ to capture camber effects), because this reduces the governing system of equations to a single linear solve (just as with the VLM). This is computationally faster to solve than the true nonlinear problem. However, this also loses substantial accuracy in lift prediction, especially in cases where nonlinearities in the lift curve are important, such as near transitional Reynolds numbers and in high-lift cases. In many cases, this may make the traditional linear lifting-line method unsuitable.

Because of this, the present work implements \emph{both} a linear and nonlinear lifting line method, with the latter retaining the full (nonlinear) lift curve slope behavior. This is done by reformulating the method to be implicit, with governing equations converted into nonlinear residual form.

In both the linear and nonlinear methods, 2D sectional data is provided using \emph{NeuralFoil}, a custom physics-informed machine learning method described in Chapter \ref{chap:physics-informed-ml}. Using NeuralFoil to obtain sectional data has negligible error compared to XFoil solutions, and it has the important property of retaining $C^1$-continuity that allows for gradient-based rootfinding methods to be used in the nonlinear case. With the linear method, the NeuralFoil evaluation is numerically differentiated about the geometric angle of attack of each wing cross section\footnote{In other words, the angle of attack with respect to the freestream velocity vector (which can be computed explicitly), not the local perturbed fluid velocity vector (which is an implicit function of the initially-unknown vortex strengths)} to construct an affine $C_L(\alpha)$ dependency. Critically, because of this local linearization step about the geometric angle of attack, even the linear lifting-line method in the implementation here can capture limited stall effects—this is a unique feature of the present work compared to other lifting-line implementations.

%The nonlinear lifting-line method has one notable drawback, which is that unlike a linear lifting-line, it is not guaranteed to produce a solution. This mostly occurs  inversion of the $C_L(\alpha)$ curve, which occur

The overall lifting line methodology presented in this section represents modern thinking about the theoretical formulation of lifting-line methods, as given by Phillips and Snyder \cite{phillips_modern_2000} and Reid \cite{reid_general_2020}; this is a generalization of the historical lifting-line formulation originally given by Prandtl in the early 20th century. The general formulation presented here has been shown to work well for non-straight lifting lines, which occurs in wings with sweep or dihedral \cite{reid_general_2020, jacobs_extension_2012, phillips_liftingline_, phillips_modern_2000}.

\subsection{Implementation}

%The lifting-line method was implemented in AeroSandbox as a traceable analysis. Both the linear and nonlinear lifting lines are

The linear version is implemented similarly to the VLM implementation, where both an explicit and an implicit solve are possible. On the other hand, the fully nonlinear lifting-line method is currently only implemented as an implicit analysis.

Numerical discretization is performed by thin-surface meshing with a chordwise paneling resolution of one. The quarter-chord lines of these panels can then be connected to obtain a lifting line for the wing.

\subsection{Example Results}

Figure \ref{fig:ll} shows analogous lifting-line analysis results for the same glider example as the VLM analysis. The reduction in discretization resolution due to the elimination of chordwise refinement is immediately apparent from the lower number of discrete panels. This leads to much shorter asymptotic runtimes, especially for vehicles with complex systems of multiple interacting lifting surfaces.

\begin{figure}[h]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{../figures/ll.png}
    \caption{AeroSandbox lifting-line analysis results for a simple glider geometry at a prescribed aerodynamic operating point. Surface color shows the vortex strength (or equivalently, $\Delta C_p$ across the wing). Streamlines show the flow field.}
    \label{fig:ll}
\end{figure}

As with the VLM, quantitative validation results for this lifting-line analysis are shown later in Section \ref{sec:aero_validation}. In general, the lifting-line method is expected to be more accurate than the VLM for aerodynamic performance prediction purposes (i.e., lift, drag, and moment prediction), due of the incorporation of 2D sectional data. The lifting line also generally leads to more interpretable results, as the local angle of attack, lift coefficient, downwash, and other properties of interest can be directly returned by the analysis. (In a VLM, these quantities must be obtained by integration along the chord, which introduces error and creates extra postprocessing work depending on the data structure of the mesh.)

On the other hand, the VLM has advantages in low-aspect-ratio cases (as spanwise flow becomes more significant, invalidating the force-free wake assumption on the straight trailing vortices), in other highly-3D flow fields, and for angular rate stability derivatives (as the VLM can better capture chord-wise variations in local velocity).

\subsection{Method Overview}

While the VLM and lifting-line methods in Sections \ref{sec:vlm} and \ref{sec:ll}

In order to support conceptual-stage aircraft design optimization, AeroSandbox includes a rapid, vectorized aerodynamics engine called AeroBuildup. AeroBuildup's methodology essentially uses a workbook-style buildup to compute aerodynamic forces, moments, and (optionally) stability derivatives. It attempts to model viscous and compressible effects on wings and fuselages across any orientation (360 degrees of 𝛼,𝛽) and arbitrary angular rates (𝑝,𝑞,𝑟).

Obviously, it will be most accurate for semi-realistic flight conditions where theory is sound and experimental data is widely available. (In other words, analyzing an airplane at 𝛼=90∘,𝑀∞=1.00, and huge angular rates will get you an answer that's roughly order-of-magnitude correct, but that's about it.)

Its formulation is largely inspired by the \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Stability_and_Control_Digital_DATCOM}{USAF Digital DATCOM}, which was a "best-practices" rapid aeroprediction tool that combined hundreds of theoretical and empirical models across a wide variety of flight regimes. Many aerodynamic submodels are indeed directly shared with Digital DATCOM.

Compared to Digital DATCOM, AeroBuildup has several advantages and limitations.
