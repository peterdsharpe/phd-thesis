%This thesis and my associated research endeavors would not have been possible without the support of so many people, and for that I am so thankful.
%
%My advisor, Professor John Hansman, is the most fiercely supportive advocate I could have asked for. Our Socratic-method discussions of various engineering design questions has helped me grow so much as a researcher, and I am always impressed by his depth of insight across such a wide number of aerospace disciplines. Whether we are hanging out in lab, flying his 152 around Mt. Wachusett, or having a BBQ in his backyard, I am very thankful for Prof. Hansman's mentorship.
%
%I would also like to thank Professor Mark Drela for various insightful conversations over the years. His contributions to aerodynamics and flight vehicle design are unparalleled, and the two classes I've taken with him have proven to be exceptionally useful.
%
%I'm also so thankful for my lively labmates in ICAT - their friendliness and warmth could melt any Boston winter. In particular, the motley crew of 35-217 has been my cornerstone through thick and thin: Matt Vernacchia, Kelly Mathesius (and the delicious carrot cakes she has baked for my birthdays), and Maddie Jansson; as well as venerated previous resident Tony Tao (Gone but never forgotten!).

%To so many new MIT friends and colleagues - Ara Mahseredijan, Chris Courtin, Annick Dewald, Julia Gaubatz, Trevor Long, Chelsea Onyeador, Charles Dawson, Katie Carroll, Sydney Dolan, Grace Wijaya, Kelvin Leung, and many more: thank you for all the good times, inspiration, encouragement, and trips to the Muddy.

%To dear friends made many long years ago - Christophe Foyer, Cameron Urban, Austin Stover (and many more from the Wash. U. Design/Build/Fly team), Nathan Duncan, Kevin Hainline, and John Duffy: as the saying goes, "Of oil, wine, and friends, the oldest is the best."
%
%Special thanks to Marta Manzin for her unwavering kindness and optimism, her inspiring maker spirit, free Italian lessons, and so much more. Grazie mille, Marta! To the other residents of SSDH - Marcus, Andrea, Banti, Sadun, and Allie - thank you for welcoming me into your home. Your company has made weathering the pandemic lockdown so much more lively.
%
%Thanks to the East Campus community and especially all of my residents on Putz, my home.
%
%Thank you to my mom, dad, and sister Julie for their support, love, and teaching from my earliest days. This work and so much more would not have been possible without you.
%
%On a more technical note, this thesis would not be possible without the open-source scientific computing community. To the maintainers of NumPy/SciPy, CasADi, IPOPT, Python, and the entire underlying stacks thereof, thank you for your selfless contributions (collectively, millions of person-hours) to scientific research everywhere.
