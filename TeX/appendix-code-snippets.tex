\section{AeroSandbox Benchmark on Beam Static Structural Analysis}

This Python code is used for the AeroSandbox performance benchmark used in Section \ref{sec:benchmark_gpkit}, with associated runtimes shown as the line labeled ``AeroSandbox'' in Figure \ref{fig:benchmark_gp_beam}. In this analysis problem, a cantilever beam is subject to a distributed load, and the goal is to compute the state of the deflected beam. The code is shown in Listing \ref{lst:gpkit_beam}.

])

sol = opti.solve()

print(sol(w[-1]))  # Prints the tip deflection; should be 1.62 m.

\section{Efficient Computational Implementation of an Arbitrary-Order Noise Estimator}
\label{sec:estimator_code_example}

While the given equation for an arbitrary-order data-driven noise estimator (Equation \ref{eq:arbitrary_order_noise_estimator}) is mathematically correct, it is nontrivial to computationally implement. This is because an implementation of the math as-written involves combinatorial coefficients that grow exponentially with the order of the estimator, quickly exceeding standard double-precision floating-point overflow. A naive implementation also has a runtime complexity that scales linearly with both with the number of samples in the dataset and the order of the estimator, making it computationally unattractive for large datasets or high-order estimators.

An efficient computational implementation of the arbitrary-order noise estimator is given in Listing \ref{lst:efficient_arbitrary_order_noise_estimator}. This example is based on syntax for NumPy 1.24.3 and SciPy 1.11.1 within Python 3. This implementation uses the log-gamma function, which is much faster for high-order estimators and delays numerical overflow until much higher orders. The implementation also uses a convolutional kernel to vectorize the summation, enabling further speedups.

One possible way to verify the correctness of the code in Listing \ref{lst:efficient_arbitrary_order_noise_estimator} is to generate a synthetic signal (e.g., a sampled sine wave), add some normally-distributed, uncorrelated, homoscedastic noise to it, and then use this code to reconstruct the standard deviation of this noise from the dirty signal.
